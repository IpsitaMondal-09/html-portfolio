<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> Hello, everyone! My name is Ipsita Mondal and I'm from Kolkata. I'm currently studying 3rd year at Maulanan Abul Kalam Azad University of Technology,West Bengal.
  Also I have completed my diploma degree. And I hope to become a software developer one day. I'm really passionate about my hobbies
  , and I'm always looking for new ways to learn and improve my skills.</p>

<p>I will never forget what happened with me on my very first day of college. Here goes the incident.
  First time in College, a bit nervous, I went to my class and sat down with all the new and eager faces. A female teacher entered our class and started with a normal introduction.
  
  During the introduction, I knew there were many students from my place. After a while, she asked for hobbies. I said I liked dance and she asked if I have I ever danced. I confidently replied I was a dancer.
  
  She then asked me to come in front of the class and dance. I was shocked. I wasn't scared but you know when you are new in a country and you have to dance on the very first day, you feel awkward.
  
  I slowly walked towards the front and asked one of the first benchers to play a song. He played the song Ore Piya. I liked the song so I didn't hesitate.
  
  Now, everyone in the class knows me. Who wouldn't, I was the one who danced on the first day of college.</p>
